# 100DaysOfMLCode
Hello World! Ruchir here. This is the log file of all the Machine Learning Code/Learning I'm going to implement in the upcoming 100 days.

### Me in 15 seconds.
 
 I live in Mumbai, India.
 
Currently I'm pursuing my Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering. I grew interested in ML/AI due to the huge amount of research being done in this field. This whole revolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) fascinates me. AI, coupled with other technologies has the power to make the world a better place. So, I decided to learn more about AI and apply these concepts to solve real world problems.

### Day 1: July 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 1) Implemented a Neural Network(NN) in Python without using any framework.
                      2) Watched 3Blue1Browns video series on NN. 
                      
**Thoughts:** It's very quick easy to code a Neural Network using powerful libraries, but sometimes knowing what's going on behind the scenes is equally important. Hence implementing a NN from scratch in python has given me a better understanding of the whole working of NN.
