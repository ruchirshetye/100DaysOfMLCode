# 100DaysOfMLCode
Hello World! Ruchir here. This is the log file of all the Machine Learning Code/Learning I'm going to implement in the upcoming 100 days.

### Me in 15 seconds. :D
 
 I live in Mumbai, India.
 
Currently I'm pursuing my Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering. I grew interested in ML/AI due to the huge amount of research being done in this field. This whole revolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) fascinates me. AI, coupled with other technologies has the power to make the world a better place. So, I decided to learn more about AI and apply these concepts to solve real world problems.

### Day 1: July 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 1) Implemented a Neural Network(NN) in Python without using any framework.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
2) Watched 3Blue1Browns video series on NN. 
                      
**Thoughts:** It's very quick easy to code a Neural Network using powerful libraries, but sometimes knowing what's going on behind the scenes is equally important. Hence implementing a NN from scratch in python has given me a better understanding of how NN's work. By watching 3Blue1Browns video series, I have got a visual understanding of the mathematical concepts used in NN. I recommend to watch his series on Neural Networks.

### Day 2: July 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 1) Implemented a Neural Network(NN) using Keras library.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
                      
**Thoughts:**  To build a sequential model of Neural Network with three layers. The Neural network can predict the probability of the customer leaving the bank. The Neural Network achieved an accuracy of 86.5%.

### Day 3: July 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learnt a about Convolutional Neural Networks.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
                      
**Thoughts:** Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is made up of 4 major steps. Those are 1) Convolution 2) Max Pooling 3) Flattening 4)Full Connection. The purpose of these layers is to detect features in images. A really good visual demo of CNN working in real time gave me a proper understanding of the process. Link to the [CNN demo](http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/)  

### Day 3: July 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Cross Entropy and Softmax.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;Got a basic idea of how LSTM and RNN work. 
                      
**Thoughts:** Consider a logistic regression produces a decimal between 0 and 1.0. For example, a logistic regression output of 0.8 from an email classifier suggests an 80% chance of an email being spam and a 20% chance of it being not spam. Clearly, the sum of the probabilities of an email being either spam or not spam is 1.0.</br>

Softmax assigns decimal probabilities to each class in a multi-class problem. Those decimal probabilities must add up to 1.0. This additional constraint helps training converge more quickly than it otherwise would.</br></br>
In Convolutional Neural Networks after you apply the softmax fucntion its is prefrerred to use a Cross Entropy function which basically acts as a cost function.
